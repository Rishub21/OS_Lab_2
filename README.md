# OSLab 2: Scheduling Algorithms Simulations 

## Instructions 

1) Please cd into the folder and into the ```src``` subdirectory 
2) Please run ```javac Solution.java``` 
3) Please run either 

   a) ```java Solution input.txt```   
   
   Where input.txt is any input that follows the specification of input in the lab specs. This will give the basic simulation output for each scheduling algorithm. 
   
   **Note** Please do **NOT** use paranthesis in the input format. Professor did mention in the comments this was a choice we could make and as such I did not build in paranthesis parsing. 
   
   b) ``` java Solution --verbose input.txt```  
   
   This command will give a more detailed output of the simulation, including the state of every process before each unit of time 
   **Note** the verbose flag comes **before** the input.txt argument.

# OSLab 2: Scheduling Algorithms Simulations 

## Instructions 

1) Please cd into the folder 

2) Please run ```javac Solution.java``` . Please ignore any Notes that come up about recompiling with xlint. This does not affect the program 

3) Please run either 

   a) ```java Solution input.txt```   
   
   Where input.txt is any txt file inside the directory at the root level that follows the specification of input in the lab specs. This will give the basic simulation output for each scheduling algorithm. 
 
   **Note** I have inlcluded sample input.txt files labeled input1.txt, input2.txt etc. As such, if you want to use different inputs, please name them differently  
   **Note** Please do **NOT** use paranthesis in the input format. Professor did mention in the comments this was a choice we could make and as such I did not build in paranthesis parsing. 
   
   b) ``` java Solution --verbose input.txt```  
   
   This command will give a more detailed output of the simulation, including the state of every process before each unit of time 
   
   **Note** the verbose flag comes **before** the input.txt argument.
